## Description

- This project is a responsive multi-section landing page, with a responsive navigation bar built dynamically based on number of sections existing in the page.

- When clicking an item from the navigation bar, the link performs a smooth scrolling to the appropriate section instead of the default jump.

- The section which is in the viewport becomes active by performing some animation to the section and heighlighting its link in the navigation bar.
